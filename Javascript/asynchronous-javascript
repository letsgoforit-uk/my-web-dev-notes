# Asynchronous Javascript

### Callbacks

```
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("5 second wait");
},5000);
```

```
const callbackFunction = () => console.log("5 second wait");

setTimeout(callbackFunction,5000);
```

Callbacks are often used in event handlers:

```
const btn;
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Button clicked!')
})
```

The disadvantage of callback functions is that they can become deeply nested, creating what is known as 'callback hell'.
